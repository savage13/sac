This file is ${SACHOME}/doc/exmples/time_shift/README

In this directory, issue the command

    run_time_shift.sh

This will do the following:

1. fg seismo
2. rtrend ; taper
3. change IZTYPE from IB to IO
   necessary if SAC time-shift is to work and input IZTYPE=IB
4. write seismo.sac
5. lowpass filter the waveform
6. write seismo_lpco5np4.sac
7. Use macro ${SACHOME}/macros/sac-ts.m to time-shift
   seismo_lpco5np4.sac by -0.05
   That writes out the result as seismo_lpco5np4_sacts.sac
8. commpile program time_shift
9. Run it to time-shift seismo_lpco5np4.sac by -0.05

Four .sac files are created.  If all worked, they will be the same
as in ./sample-run.
