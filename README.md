# Seismic Analysis Code (SAC)

Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) is a general purpose waveform analysis and processing application.  Originally developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, SAC is now maintained by the [IRIS](https://www.iris.edu/hq/) community and distributed from the [IRIS DMC](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/).

Information on [Downloading SAC](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/forms/sac/) and the [official SAC Documentation](https://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/manual.html) is available directly from [IRIS](https://www.iris.edu/hq/), who coordinates releases due to licensing restrictions.

## Contents
